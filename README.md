# LASD – Data Structures and Algorithms Laboratory
University of Naples Federico II – Academic Year 2023–2024

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was developed for the course "Laboratorio di Algoritmi e Strutture Dati" and is divided into three main parts, each focused on implementing fundamental data structures in C++, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## 🧩 Implemented data structures
- Generic containers (using C++ templates)
- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues (implemented with both arrays and lists)
- Binary trees and traversal techniques
- Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Hash tables with collision resolution strategies

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a dedicated testing section for each data structure, designed to:

- Verify the correctness of basic operations (insert, remove, search, traversal, etc.)
- Handle edge cases and invalid inputs
- Compare different implementations in terms of behavior and performance
- Ensure reliability and modularity through test-driven development

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: C++
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Compiler: g++ 
- Build system: Makefile

## 🎯 Goals
- Apply OOP principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation) in C++
- Implement reusable and type-safe generic containers using templates
- Analyze the complexity and performance of various data structures
